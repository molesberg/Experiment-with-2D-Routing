# Experiment-with-Routes

I did some playing around with routing between x, y points in December 2022/January 2023.
The goal was to find the most efficient travel route amongst a set of points of interest.
However, it ended up more as an exeperiment on aligning several search areas with different origins and iterating through a large set of possibilities. 

If I was to return to this problem, I would research more advanced pathing algorithms than comparing *all possible* paths.
